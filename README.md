# Summary of Insights
Six major products accounting for a total sales of $118,726, 350.3 were observed. Of the six products, Paseo was the top performing product with a total sales figure of $330,111,43.95 while Carretera was the least with $138,153,07.89, even though Paseo was the 4th in terms of product manufactured during the year. Year 2014 saw an increase in the number of manufactured products compared to 2013 and also had the most discounts on sold products at 77% compared to 23% discount given in 2013. Paseo had the most sales price discounts and this could account for its high performance through the year.

The Segment responsible for the most sales was the 'Government' segment while the country responsible for the most sales was United States. Most sales were made in the the month of October even though ironically Velo had more product sales compared to Paseo. However, for the months of January, May, June, November and December, Paseo was the top selling product. 

The upward trend of product manufacturing and profit obtained in 2014 when compared with 2013 is impressive and it remains to be seen if these impressive results will be replicated in year 2015 or if Paseo will maintain its lead as the top performing product.
